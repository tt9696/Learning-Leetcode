# [1046] Last Stone Weight
# If the stones are equal, both are destroyed.
# If they are not equal, the smaller one is destroyed, 
# and the larger one becomes stone1 - stone2.
# Repeat this until at most one stone is left.
# Return the weight of the last remaining stone, or 0 if all stones are destroyed.
